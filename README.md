## UPB OpenGL Framework


🖊️Lab tasks cover:

* The usage of the Geometry Shader.
* Generation of Bezier surfaces using the Geometry Shader.
* Reflections and Framebuffers.
* Cubemaps and Refractions.
* Particle Systems.
* Post Processing effects.



📝Final project includes:

* A Bezier river with 3 branches that generate with different control points each time.
* Bezier mountains that generate in-between and on the sides of the river.
* Water texture that reflects/refracts the skybox.
* A boat that moves on the Bezier control points, randomizing between the three branches each time.
* Depth of field implementation as a Post Processing effect.
